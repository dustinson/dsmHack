                            DsmHack is a not-for-profit organization working to elevate and strengthen the community by building software, learning from each other and giving back. <br />The organization centers around the idea of “Build.Learn.Give.”, which includes building technology solutions and relationships throughout the community, learning new skills or thought processes and giving time and skills to those non-profits who need, but cannot afford it. <br />The 48-hour hack-a-thon is planned by a committee of representatives from various companies throughout Des Moines and is not tied to a single organization or sponsor. <br />More information about dsmHack can be found <!--at its website, located at dsmhack.org or -->by emailing <a href="mailto:info@dsmHack.org" class="color-white">info@dsmHack.org</a>.

                            <dt>Why was dsmHack created?</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>There is a wealth of technology talent in the Des Moines area and amazing nonprofits that continue to help Central Iowa win awards as one of the country's best place to live. In an effort to team technical resources with the nonprofits of this community, we've created this event to bring the best of both worlds together.</p>
                                <p>From February 26-28, these two groups will come together to build and implement tools to make the area's nonprofits operate more effectively so they can continue to focus on doing good. Through this event, we will learn a significant amount about the needs of local organizations and how we can work together to make this community stronger!</p>
                            </dd>
                            <dt>Why should my non-profit organization submit to be involved?</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>With organizations constantly operating on a tight budget and with limited talent to work with, processes often become paper-heavy and labor intensive. We want to help you change that. Submitting your non-profit for this event will provide the opportunity to work directly with technology professionals that are always creating efficiencies. Great tools will be built or improved for your organization and you will learn a tremendous amount!</p>

                            <dd>
                                <p>Technology professionals will arrive on Thursday night to mingle and hear the pitches from nonprofits about what needs they have. From there, teams will form around the needs of the organizations.  Over the next 48 hours the participants and organizations will hack their hearts out!  There will be food served, snacks, beverages, great camaraderie and a tremendous amount of learning/building. The event culminates on Saturday with presentations of what the teams created and then a post-event happy hour!</p>

                                <p>The tagline for dsmHack is "build.learn.give".  We want to use this time for our developers, designers, project managers and business minds to apply their existing skills to people who need them. The event will provide food, beverages (caffeine + beer), a cool t-shirt and a great chance for tech minds to work with other peers in the community and learn new skills.</p>
                                <p>This should be a great opportunity to learn and apply some new technology that you "just didn't have time to explore" in the past.  You can even deviate from your typical tech stack if you want.</p>

                            <dd>
                                <p>There is no cost or commitment needed from the non-profits other than a little bit of time.  We've got some wonderful sponsors who are going to cover the expenses of this event.  We may be in a position to contribute some nominal funds to help sustain the solutions as well (i.e. web hosting).</p>
                                <p>There is a nominal cost for you to attend. It's $20. This is to ensure you have some skin in the game. We want to make sure participants sign up and show up.  The $20 covers a t-shirt, food and some tasty beverages!  Our great sponsors are kicking in a lot more than that for all the fun treats you'll indulge in over the course of the event.</p>
                                <p>Please contact us if the cost is prohibiting you from joining.  Email <a href="mailto:info@dsmHack.org" class="color-white">info@dsmHack.org</a> and let's chat.</p>

                                <p>Tell your team lead or supervisor that you're giving back to the community and the time is being spent to support 501c3 organizations. Many companies offer time off for volunteer efforts. Use that time! This is also a great time to learn something new which may be used at your job in the near future. Many companies struggle to find learning opportunities for their devs.  This is a win-win which will make great use of your time at almost no cost.</p>

                            <dd>
                                <p>No worries! We still ask that you come Thursday night to join a team and pick a project that will work with your time schedule. We understand there will be participants joining around lunch on Friday and after work on Friday. For the sake of doing good, anytime is a good time.</p>

                            <dd>
                                <p>Absolutely! We will need designers, project and product managers, business minds and any other creatives to work with the organizations to make sure their needs are not met - but exceeded! You will add substantial value to any team.</p>

                                <p>We encourage both! Some organizations are needing a new solution created, while many are using pre-existing software and they need help implementing or optimizing it to continue being productive.</p>
